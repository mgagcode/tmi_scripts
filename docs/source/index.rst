Welcome to TMI's documentation!
===============================

The TMI platform is a manufacturing test system that provides a framework for creating
test programs to test your product, and a backend dashboard to monitor production.  The
platform is intended to allow you to focus on testing your product, rather than the
infrastructure to manage the data, scripts, users, roles, reporting and other mundane stuff.
