TMIStation has the concept of Users and Roles.

The User logged in and performing tests will be noted in the Result JSON.

You may decide on one global operator User, or a User for each individual.

Roles
*****

The following roles are defined,

::

    "roles": {
        # Framework Roles
        "ENABLED": "Enabled",
        "ACCOUNT": "Account",
        "ADMIN":   "Administrator",  # rights to do anything

        # App specific Roles
        "OPERATOR":   "Operator",
        "CONFIGMAN":  "Config Management",
        "DEVELOPER":  "Developer",
        "SERVERSYNC": "ServerSync",  # causes user to be pushed to all stations
    },


Enabled
=======

Without this role, the User cannot log into the system.  When a User is created,
this role is NOT set.  After a User is created, you must access the Roles menu
and add `Enabled` to the User for them to be able to login.

Admin
=====

The Admin(istrator) role has access to all system functions and menus.

In general its good practice to have two Users with Admin role.
