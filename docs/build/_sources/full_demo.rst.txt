Full Demo
==========

The Full Demo assume you have followed the instructions for the :doc:`basic_demo`.

The Full Demo works by creating a local file structure and telling the ``tmistation`` Docker container to use that
local file system.  This requires a more advanced ``docker run`` command.

Additional Requirements
-----------------------

* install git::

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git

  * if you are unfamiliar with ``git``, in short it is a free cloud based software version control platform
  * ``git`` is an advanced tool, and although widely used, it can be an complicated tool to use.  There are
    GUI programs that try and make ``git`` easier to use, and a quick google can point you to some for your host operating system.
  * TMI instructions (attempt to) only use the simple basic commands of ``git``


Clone TMIScripts
----------------

* There is a prescriptive directory structure to use, and that is stored on ``github`` in a project called ``tmi_scripts``
* This github repo is where you would ultimately store and version control your own scripts

  * Instead of cloning the repo, you would fork [1]_ (copy) it, making it your own, and then add your own code
* The instructions below will create a folder called *git/tmistation* which git will copy the required files into

* Clone ``tmi_scripts``::

    mkdir ~/git
    mkdir ~/git/tmistation
    cd ~/git/tmistation
    git clone https://github.com/mgagcode/tmi_scripts.git

* Run TMIStation::

    cd ~/git/tmistation/tmi_scripts/public
    docker run -ti -p 6800:6800 -v $(pwd):/app/public tmistation

* Open Google Chrome to

        http://127.0.0.1:6800
